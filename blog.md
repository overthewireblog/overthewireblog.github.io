A personal tracking of my exercises at [OverTheWire](http://www.overthewire.org)

- TODO List:
  - [ ] Better code blocks
  - [x] ~~go back over exercise 23 -> 24~~
  - [ ] clean up syntax references on code snippets
  - [x] ~~clean up overall formatting~~
  - [ ] create separate scripts to add to repo
  - [ ] check for new exercises in the bandit category
  - [ ] add natas

The best part is that it's FREE and can be started by a complete beginner!!
