### Level 6 -> 7
#### Game Instructions
>The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

Alrighty let's get started on this badboy.

Get `ssh`'d in there:
```bash
ssh -p 2220 bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7
```
Now the instructions say it is **somewhere on the server**. This means that we can't operate from the `/home` directory like we have been. Let's get to root:
```bash
cd /
```
This will get us to the root directory where we can begin...

Again, let's use `find` to search these attributes. This time, however, we're going to add all of them together for one-command awesomeness:
```bash
# This command is searching Everywhere for a file owned by group `bandit6` and user `bandit7` that will be exactly 33 bytes in size
find * -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6
```
This gives us the following:
```bash
bandit6@bandit:/$ find * -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6

Notice the large list of *permission denied* results?

This game made it a little easy for us this time. The only file we can access is
`var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`
So let's `cat` that file and bam! Password.
```bash
password: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
```
