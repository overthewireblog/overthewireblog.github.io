Now that I was in bash I just ls the directory and ran cat on the final bandit33 file:Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly workingon new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.That’s it.

However, you’ll notice that the shell immediately closes out. So let’s take a look at the above pulled shell config… Notice the more ~/text.txt. It’s using more to view the file so we’ll use that to break in.No more will show one page of data at a time. So what happens if the window is just a bit too small? It won’t close. This will allow us to use vim to break out an gain a shell.Make the terminal window super tiny (less than 6 lines) and try to get back in using ssh -i sshkey.private bandit26@localhost. You’ll notice it hangs (Yay!).Now hit v to bring up command options in vim.

Just to clear things up.Now the game is telling us that we need to find the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.Let’s cd into the inhere directory to get to work:cd inhereWhen we ls this directory, we’ll see a bunch of files starting with that pesky - that we came across earlier. So we know that we’re going to have to use ./ to cat them effectively.This particular exercise is best tackled manually. We’ll simply cat each file and look for human-readable text:cat ./-file00 ./-file01 ./-file02 ./-file03 ./-file04 ./-file05 ./-file06 ./-file07 ./-file08 ./-file09??????????~%C[?걱&amp;gt;??| ????U&quot;7?w???H??ê?Q??(???#????T?v??(?ִ?????A*?2J?Ş؇_?y7?.A??u??#???w$N?c?-??Db3??=???=&amp;lt;?W?????ht?Z??!??{?U    ?+??pm???;??:D??^??@?gl?Q??@?%@???ZP*E??1?V???̫*????koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKhFPn?  &#39;?U???M??/u XS?mu?z???хN?{??Y?d4????]3?????9(?Do you see the human-readable text?

You just need to understand how spaces &quot; &quot; work on the command line. If you just simply run cat spaces in this filename, you’ll get Thiscat: spaces: No such file or directorycat: in: No such file or directorycat: this: No such file or directorycat: filename: No such file or directoryThis is because separating by spaces will always look for another file. Basically you’re asking cat to look for 4 different files. So we need to escape the spaces.There are two options here:  We can escape each spacecat spaces in this filename… escaping each space OR;  We can encapsulate the entire string in &quot; &quot;cat &quot;spaces in this filename&quot;Either one will make sure that cat treats the whole string as one file name… giving you the next password in the series:UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK",
